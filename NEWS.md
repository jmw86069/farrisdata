# version 0.0.2.900

## New data

* `GencodeVM12mm10cai` is a numeric vector of codon adaptability
index (CAI) values for mouse mm10 Gencode vM12.
* `GencodeVM12mm10caiCtLow` is an integer count of codons where the
CAI value is 0.5 or lower.
* `GencodeVM12mm10caiCtBad` is an integer count of codons where the
CAI value is 0.3 or lower.
* `GencodeVM12mm10cai` is a numeric vector of codon adaptability
index (CAI) values for mouse mm10 Gencode vM12.
* `GencodeVM12mm10cdsLength` is a numeric vector of CDS lengths
for mouse mm10 Gencode vM12.

# version 0.0.1.900

## New data

* AinsleyGenes, NakayamaGenes, CajigasGenes were added as reference
data from three published studies detecting hippocampal CA1 dendrite
genes, from mouse, mouse, and rat, respectively. These objects are
character vectors of gene symbols.
